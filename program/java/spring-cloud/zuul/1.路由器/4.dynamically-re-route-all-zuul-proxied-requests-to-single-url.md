First, use PRE_TYPE instead of ROUTE_TYPE (aka "route")

@Override
public String filterType() {
    return FilterConstants.PRE_TYPE;
}
Second, specify correct filterOrder

@Override
public int filterOrder() {
    return FilterConstants.SEND_FORWARD_FILTER_ORDER;
}
Third, you need to remove URI containing "/alerts/public", which is appended to the routeHost by zuul

@Override
public Object run() {

    ctx.set("requestURI", "");

    // your code

    return null;
}
Finally, override forwarding url in the code (//your code). And you have to specify at least one route (cause zuul filters don't work if there are no routes) to proxy "not outaged" requests to the same host 8080 like this

zuul.routes.api.path=/api/**
zuul.routes.api.url=http://localhost:8080/api
IMHO, zuul is not a very convenient way to do this.
